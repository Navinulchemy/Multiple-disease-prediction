# This is a project on predicting multiple diseases using three ml models in an single streamlit web app


# The diabetes.ipynb is a notebook file which contains the code to create the prediction model for diabetes.


# The heart_disese_pred.ipynb is a notebook file which contains the code to create the prediction model for heart disease.


# The parkinsons_pred.ipynb is a notebook file which contains the code to create the prediction model for parkinsons disease.


# diadetes_prediction.sav is a saved model using pickle which is used to predict the diabetes disease.


# heart_disease.sav is a saved model using pickle which is used to predict the heart disease.


# parkinsons.sav is a saved model using pickle which is used to predict the parkinsons disease.


# streamlit.py contains all the necessary code to luanch an temporary webpage using streamlit to predict multiple disease.


# To run the file open terminal and type [streamlit run "streamlit.py" ] this will direct you to an webpage locally..
